# Twitch auth is read from environment variables (recommended with docker-compose env_file):
# - TWITCH_CLIENT_ID
# - TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET
# - TWITCH_REFRESH_TOKEN   (recommended)
# - TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN    (optional fallback; not recommended long-term)
# - TWITCH_CHANNEL_NAME    (optional; overrides channel_name above)

# Optional: command cooldowns (milliseconds)
# - default_cooldown_ms applies to all commands unless overridden
# - cooldown_ms allows per-command overrides by command name
commands:
  # Cooldown applied to all commands unless overridden below.
  # Set to 0 to disable global cooldown.
  default_cooldown_ms: 2000

  # Per-command cooldown overrides by command name.
  # Set to 0 to disable cooldown for a specific command.
  cooldown_ms:
    lw: 2000

# Optional: Channel Point Redeems -> plugin handlers
#
# How it works:
# - You create a Channel Point Reward in Twitch.
# - Put its reward_id (recommended) or reward_title below.
# - Set a handler key (see the built-in list below).
# - Optionally pass params and a per-user cooldown.
redeems:
  enabled: false

  # When true, unmatched redeems are logged to console (helps you find reward_id/title).
  log_unmatched: true

  # Bindings are checked top-to-bottom; the first match wins.
  bindings:
    # Example: spawn the redeemer's NPC at the spawn point
    # - reward_id: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    #   handler: "npc.spawn"
    #   cooldown_ms: 0
    #   params:
    #     message: "@{user} spawned their NPC!"

    # Example: make all Twitch NPCs aggro a random online player
    # - reward_title: "NPC AGGRO"
    #   handler: "npc.aggro"
    #   cooldown_ms: 10000
    #   params:
    #     seconds: 30

    # Example: make all Twitch NPCs attack a random online player
    # - reward_title: "NPC ATTACK"
    #   handler: "npc.attack"
    #   cooldown_ms: 15000
    #   params:
    #     seconds: 30
    #     hearts_per_hit: 1.0

    # Example: send a message to Twitch chat
    # - reward_title: "SAY HI"
    #   handler: "chat.say"
    #   params:
    #     message: "Thanks @{user}! You redeemed {reward}."
